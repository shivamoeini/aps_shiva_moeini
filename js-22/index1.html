    <h1>Asynchronous</h1>
    <p>

        The term asynchronous refers to two or more objects or events not existing or happening at the same time (or multiple related things happening without waiting for the previous one to complete). In computing, the word "asynchronous" is used in two major
        contexts. Networking and communications Asynchronous communication is a method of exchanging messages between two or more parties in which each party receives and processes messages whenever it's convenient or possible to do so, rather than doing
        so immediately upon receipt. Additionally, messages may be sent without waiting for acknowledgement, with the understanding that if a problem occurs, the recipient will request corrections or otherwise handle the situation. For humans, e-mail
        is an asynchronous communication method; the sender sends an email and the recipient will read and reply to the message when it's convenient to do so, rather than doing so at once. And both sides can continue to send and receive messages whenever
        they wish, instead of having to schedule them around each other. When software communicates asynchronously, a program may make a request for information from another piece of software (such as a server), and continue to do other things while waiting
        for a reply. For example, the AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) programming technique—now usually "Ajax", even though JSON is usually used rather than XML in modern applications—is a mechanism that requests relatively small amounts of data
        from the server using HTTP, with the result being returned when available rather than immediately</p>
